### 3 Words Challenge

- This game is played by three players.
- Each player has a plate in front of them, with 4 to 6 cells.
- *The goal of the game is to complete a word on all the three plates.*
  (You won't win the game only by completing your word!)
- Players take turn to take one alphabet card from the center pane.
- You can also replace a card you previously placed with the new one. The previous card will go back to the center pane.

# Help functions
You can't talk to other players, but there are two messages you can send.

** PLEASE **
- If you want a card that was taken by another player, send her/him a "PLEASE" request, however, you can't mention which card.
- If s/he accepts your request, s/he chooses one on her/his plate and you will have it in your turn (even if that's not what you wanted).

** SUGGEST **
- In another player's turn, if you want to suggest an alphabet on the plates other than that player's or the center pane, you can send her/him the card, but you can't mention to which plate.
- If s/he wants the card, s/he can take it by clicking and placing it to one of her/his remaining cells (even if the original holder didn't want it to be taken). Then, the turn is over.

If you receive either message, you need to react within a certain seconda, otherwise the message will disappear and you won't be able to respond.
